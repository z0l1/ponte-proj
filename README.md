# Ponte Frontend Task

### Steps to run

prerequisites:

-   have Node.JS installed on the machine.
-   make sure ports 5173 and 3000 are not in use
-   please check out the devnotes where I share a few (maybe dumb) concerns about the quick BE I use [devnotes link to section](https://github.com/z0l1/ponte-proj/blob/main/DEVNOTES.md#fake-backend) (SPOILER: licensing)

#### 1. clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/z0l1/ponte-proj
```

#### 2. step into the folder (by default it should be ponte-proj)

```
cd ponte-proj
```

#### 3. install npm packages

```
npm i
```

#### 4. run the project using the dev script

```
npm run fulldev
```

this starts both FE and BE

#### 5. open http://localhost:5173

### Devnotes

I have also created a DEVNOTES.md to document some of my thought process.

### Time

(rounding up) I have spent about 6 hours working on the project. of which

-   about 1 hour was setting everything up (packages, BE)
-   about 5 was the development time.
